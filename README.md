# Speed Verse - a pace converter

## 專案概述

this is a web app (PWA)to help runner to easily convert pace to speed. It often happens to runner that now knowing how to adjust the dial on treadmill in the gym. This tool provides an easy and intuitive way for runners to do the math. 

- The system MUST provide an input field for the user to enter speed in kilometers per hour (km/h).
- Users can switch between metric (kilometers) and imperial (miles), with metric set as the default.
- The system MUST provide an input field for the user to enter pace in minutes per kilometer (min/km).
- The system MUST provide a 'Convert' button that triggers the conversion process.
- The system MUST accurately convert speed (km/h) to pace (min/km) and vice-versa.
- The system MUST present the converted value in the appropriate output field (either Speed or Pace) in a clear and easily readable format.
- The system SHOULD provide a clear and intuitive user interface optimized for mobile devices.
- The application COULD remember the last used value in either Speed or Pace to be reused on the next load. (Optional)

## 主要功能

- The system MUST provide an input field for users to enter speed in kilometers per hour (km/h) or miles per hour (mph), depending on the selected unit.
- The system MUST allow users to switch between metric (kilometers) and imperial (miles) units, with metric (kilometers) set as the default unit upon initial load.
- The system MUST provide an input field for users to enter pace in minutes per kilometer (min/km) or minutes per mile (min/mile), depending on the selected unit.
- The system MUST provide a 'Convert' button that triggers the conversion process.
- The system MUST accurately convert speed to pace and vice-versa, based on the selected units (km/h to min/km or mph to min/mile).
- The system MUST present the converted value in the appropriate output field (either Speed or Pace) in a clear and easily readable format (e.g., '5:00' for pace or '10.0' for speed).
- The system SHOULD provide a clear and intuitive user interface optimized for mobile devices.
- The application COULD remember the last used value in either Speed or Pace (and the selected unit) to be reused on the next load.
